% Time-dependent Schredinger equation
% i*hp (d/dt)|Psi(t)> = Oper_H|Psi(t)>
% where
% i is the imaginary unit
% hp is the reduced Planck constant which is hp=h/(2*pi)

% Time-dependent Schredinger equation in position basis
% i*hp (d/dt)Psi(R,t) = [(-hp^2/(2*mu))laplacian()+V(R,t)] Psi(R,t)
% where 
% mu is the particle's "reduced mass",
% V(R,t) is its potential energy
% Psi is the wave function

% Time-independent Schr?dinger equation (general)
% Oper_H|Psi> = E|Psi>

% Time-independent Schredinger equation (single nonrelativistic particle)
% [(-hp^2/(2*mu))laplacian()+V(R)]Psi(R) = E*Psi(R)
