% Spin density matrix and its basic properties

% Basic definitions

% We have two particle beams
% Na particles in state |hia>
% Nb particles in state |hib> 

% Operator OpRo used for description of the combined beam
% OpRo=Wa*|hia>*<hia|+Wb*|hib>*<hib|                 (1.1.18)
% where Wa=Na/N, Wb=Nb/N,N=Na+Nb
% Operator OpRo is called  the density operator or statistical operator
