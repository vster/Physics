% Stationary state of a free particle.

% OperH(psi(x))=E*psi(x)

% Nabla^2(psi_n(ksi))+(2*m/hp^2)*(E-U)psi_n(ksi)=0         (2.8)
% E is total energy
% U is potential energy
% E-U is kinetic energy

% A single particle has a certain momentum p and kinetic energy p^2/(2*m)

% solutions of the equation are
% eigenfunctions of the momentum operator
% psi(x)=c*exp(i*(p/hp)*x)=c*exp(+-i*(sqrt(2*m*(E-U))/hp)*x)    (2.9)

% A complete, time-dependent solution of equation (2.1) for its
% bodice particle is a function
% Psi=x*exp(-(i/hp)*(E*t-p*x))

% Each such function is a plane wave. 
% The frequency of this wave is E/hp,
% its wave vector is k=p/hp 
% (the absolute value of the vector is equal to the wave number k), 
% and the corresponding wavelength 
% lambda = 2*pi*hp/p 
% is called de Broglie wavelength of a particle.
