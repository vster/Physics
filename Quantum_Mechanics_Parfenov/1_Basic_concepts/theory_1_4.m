% Average value

% <A> = sum(n) an*|cn|^2
% where cn = int Psi_n'*Psi d_ksi
% |cn|^2 - the probability of obtaining the n-th value

% In the generalization to the case of the continuous spectrum 
% for the normalized wave function Psi mean
% <A> = int Psi' Oper_A Psi d_ksi                      (1.8)

% In the case of finding the average value 
% for non-normalized functions
% <A> = int()Psi' Oper_A Psi d_ksi / int()Psi'*Psi d_ksi     (1.9)

% In addition to the average characteristic of a physical quantity
% is the variance
% sigma_A^2 = <A^2> - <A>^2                        (1.10)
% where 
% <A^2> = sum(n)an^2*|Cn|^2 - for discrete spectrum
% <A^2> = int(V)Psi' Oper_A Psi d_ksi - for continuous spectrum

% <Am> = int Psi_m' Oper_A Psi_m d_ksi = Am
