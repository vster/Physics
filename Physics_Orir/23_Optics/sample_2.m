% The field from the gap 1
% E1=j*E0*cos(w*t-k*r1)
% The field from the gap 2
% E2=k*E0*cos(w*t-k*r2)

% E=j*E0*cos(w*t-k*r1)+k*E0*cos(w*t-k*r2)

% Point a
% E=sqrt(2)*E0*cos(w*t-k*r1)
% The field is directed under 45 grad to vertical
% linear right diagonal polarization
% I=E^2=2*E0^2=2*I0

% Pont b
% E=E0*cos(w*t-k*r1)
% circular right polarization
% I=E^2=I0

% Pont c
% E=sqrt(2)*E0*cos(w*t-k*r1)
% The field is directed under 45 grad to vertical
% linear left diagonal polarization
% I=E^2=2*E0^2=2*I0

% Point d
% Similar as at point a
% E=sqrt(2)*E0*cos(w*t-k*r1)
% The field is directed under 45 grad to vertical
% linear right diagonal polarization
% I=E^2=2*I0
