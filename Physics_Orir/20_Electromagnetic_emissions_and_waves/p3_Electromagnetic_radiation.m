% Electromagnetic radiation

% Plane current radiation
% From (20-2) we get
% int_c()B*ds=(4*pi*k0/c^2)*I=(4*pi*k0/c^2)*J*b
% or
% 2*B*b=(4*pi*k0/c^2)*J*b
% From here we find
% B=(2*pi*k0/c^2)*J   - Field near flat current   (20-3)
% This expression is the same as (18-5)

% We write the final results
% dEy/dx=-dBz/dt                         (20-4)
% diff(Ey,x)=-diff(Bz,t)
% and
% d2Bz/dx2=1/c^2*d2Bz/dt2  (wave equation)   (20-5)
% diff(Bz,x,2)=1/c^2*diff(Bz,t,2)
